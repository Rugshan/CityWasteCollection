# CityWasteCollection

Simple city waste collection system built using Python.

- Used NetworkX and MatPlotLib to simulate a neighbourhood consisting of nodes (intersections) and paths (roads).
- Uses gRPC for communications between the server and the clients (waste removal trucks
- Uses RabbitMQ to provide residents with updates.
  - Residents can choose to subscribe to a specific section of the street or enable all notifications.
